# Contributing

Contributions to Superforms are very welcome! The issues and discussion pages on [Github](https://github.com/ciscoheat/sveltekit-superforms) are always open for comments, and if you want to contribute some code, it's quite easy. Just fork either the [Superforms](https://github.com/ciscoheat/sveltekit-superforms) repository or its [website](https://github.com/ciscoheat/superforms-web), and then you just need to execute the following to be up and running:

```
npm install
npm run dev
```

```
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

If you find a typo on the website, you can make a quick PR directly in its [Github repository](https://github.com/ciscoheat/superforms-web/tree/main/src/routes).
